## ðŸŸ¦ **Basic JavaScript Questions**

### 1. **What are the different data types in JavaScript?**
**Answer:**  
JavaScript has:
- **Primitive types**: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Null`, `Undefined`, `Symbol`, `BigInt`
- **Non-primitive types**: `Object`, `Array`, `Function`

**Example:**
```javascript
let name = "Lalit";       // String
let age = 35;             // Number
let isManager = true;     // Boolean
let salary = null;        // Null
let department;           // Undefined
let id = Symbol("id");    // Symbol
let bigNum = 12345678901234567890n; // BigInt
let employee = { name, age };       // Object
```

---

### 2. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?**
**Answer:**
- `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared.
- `let` is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
- `const` is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.

**Example:**
```javascript
function testScope() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 10;
    let y = 20;
    const z = 30;
  }
  console.log(x); // 10
  // console.log(y); // Error
  // console.log(z); // Error
}
```

---

### 3. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**
**Answer:**  
Hoisting moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;

hoisted(); // "Hoisted function"
function hoisted() {
  console.log("Hoisted function");
}
```

---

### 4. **What is the difference between `==` and `===`?**
**Answer:**
- `==` compares values with type coercion.
- `===` compares both value and type.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log(5 == "5");  // true
console.log(5 === "5"); // false
```

---

### 5. **What are arrow functions and how are they different?**
**Answer:**
Arrow functions are concise and do not bind their own `this`.

**Example:**
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

---

### 6. **What is a closure in JavaScript?**
**Answer:**
A closure is a function that remembers its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

**Example:**
```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}
const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```

---

### 7. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**
**Answer:**
- `undefined`: variable declared but not assigned.
- `null`: explicitly set to "no value".

**Example:**
```javascript
let a;
let b = null;
console.log(a); // undefined
console.log(b); // null
```

---

### 8. **What is the event loop in JavaScript?**
**Answer:**
The event loop handles asynchronous operations by pushing callbacks to the call stack when the stack is empty.

**Example:**
```javascript
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Async"), 0);
console.log("End");
// Output: Start, End, Async
```

---

### 9. **What is the purpose of `this` keyword?**
**Answer:**
`this` refers to the object that is executing the current function.

**Example:**
```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Lalit",
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
  }
};
person.greet(); // Hello, Lalit
```

---

### 10. **What are template literals?**
**Answer:**
Template literals use backticks and `${}` for interpolation.

**Example:**
```javascript
let name = "Lalit";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); // Hello, Lalit!
```

---

## ðŸŸ© **Node.js-Specific Questions**

### 1. **What is Node.js?**
**Answer:**
Node.js is a runtime that allows JavaScript to run on the server side using the V8 engine.

---

### 2. **What is `require()` used for?**
**Answer:**
`require()` is used to import modules in Node.js.

**Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
```

---

### 3. **Difference between `require` and `import`?**
**Answer:**
- `require`: CommonJS, synchronous
- `import`: ES Modules, asynchronous

---

### 4. **What are CommonJS and ES Modules?**
**Answer:**
- **CommonJS**: Uses `require()` and `module.exports`
- **ES Modules**: Uses `import` and `export`

---

### 5. **What is `package.json`?**
**Answer:**
It contains metadata about the project and manages dependencies.

---

### 6. **Synchronous vs Asynchronous code?**
**Answer:**
- **Synchronous**: Blocks execution
- **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking, uses callbacks/promises

**Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Async
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

---

### 7. **What are callbacks, promises, and async/await?**
**Answer:**
They handle async operations.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Promise
function getData() {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve("Done"), 1000));
}

// Async/Await
async function showData() {
  const result = await getData();
  console.log(result);
}
showData(); // Done
```

---

### 8. **What is the `fs` module?**
**Answer:**
It allows interaction with the file system.

**Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
fs.writeFileSync('test.txt', 'Hello Node.js');
```

---

### 9. **How does Node.js handle concurrency?**
**Answer:**
Using a single-threaded event loop and non-blocking I/O.

---

### 10. **What is middleware in Express.js?**
**Answer:**
Middleware functions process requests before they reach the route handler.

**Example:**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware executed');
  next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World'));
```
